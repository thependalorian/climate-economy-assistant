We also saw impactful developments at the regional and federal levels. In February\n2023, the six New England States announced in the New England States Transmission Initiative that they\nare seeking joint funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to support innovative electricity\ntransmission proposals that would grow the region’s supply of clean, reliable, and affordable energy. NECEC\nhas followed and amplified this important progress towards building out the infrastructure needed to\nsupport clean distributed resources.\nMassachusetts entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Maine to consider joining in a 1,200\nMW transmission and 1,000 MW wind procurement conducted by the Maine Public Utilities Commission\n(PUC). By year’s end, the two states quickly finalized this historic agreement to support the development\nand transmission of clean energy resources. While a November 2023 ballot referendum delayed progress,\nthe two states are committed to finding pathways to coordinate clean energy development and\nprocurements.\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 2023 introduced a rule to reform current procedures\nused for connecting new energy generating facilities to the grid. The changes are expected to backlogs for\nprojects seeking to connect to the transmission system, improve certainty in the interconnection processes\nmanaged by the dozens of transmission providers around the country, and ensure access to the\ntransmission system for new technologies. NECEC has been working with members, utilities, state agencies\nand ISO-New England to advocate for transparency and predictability for clean energy developers.\nSolar & Storage \n Offshore Wind Energy Efficiency &\nDemand Response\nClean Transportation",
