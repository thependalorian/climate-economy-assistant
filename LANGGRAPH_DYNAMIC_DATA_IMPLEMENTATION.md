# LangGraph Dynamic Data Retrieval Implementation

## Overview

Successfully transformed the Climate Ecosystem Assistant from using hardcoded partner information to dynamic data retrieval from Supabase as the single source of truth. This ensures agents always provide current, accurate information about partner organizations, programs, and opportunities.

## Key Improvements

### ✅ Before vs After

**BEFORE (Hardcoded):**
```typescript
UPSKILLING_PARTNERS: [
  'Franklin Cummings Tech: Renewable energy programs',
  'MassHire Career Centers: Workforce development',
  // Static, outdated information
]
```

**AFTER (Dynamic):**
```typescript
// Real-time data retrieval
const partners = await getPartnerOrganizations();
const trainingPrograms = await getPartnerPrograms(undefined, 'training');
const jobOpportunities = await getJobOpportunities();
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dynamic Data Retrieval Functions

#### `getPartnerOrganizations(organizationType?, specialization?)`
- Retrieves active partner organizations from Supabase
- Supports filtering by organization type and specialization
- Returns real-time partner data with contact information

#### `getPartnerPrograms(partnerId?, programType?, skillsNeeded?)`
- Fetches training programs with partner details
- Filters by program type (training, certification, etc.)
- Matches programs to specific skill requirements

#### `getJobOpportunities(partnerId?)`
- Gets current job listings from partner organizations
- Includes partner details and application URLs
- Filters for active opportunities only

#### `getUserSkillGaps(userId, targetJobId?)`
- Analyzes user skills vs. job requirements
- Identifies specific skill gaps
- Returns structured skill gap analysis

### 2. Enhanced Agent Specialization

#### Career Specialist (Liv)
```typescript
// Dynamic partner data retrieval
const partners = await getPartnerOrganizations();
const trainingPrograms = await getPartnerPrograms(undefined, 'training');
const jobOpportunities = await getJobOpportunities();
const skillGapAnalysis = await getUserSkillGaps(state.user_id);

// Real-time prompts with current data
CURRENT_PARTNER_ORGANIZATIONS: ${partners.map(p => p.name).join(', ')}
AVAILABLE_TRAINING_PROGRAMS: ${trainingPrograms.map(p => `${p.partner_organizations?.name}: ${p.title}`).join(', ')}
USER_SKILL_GAPS: ${skillGapAnalysis.skillGaps.join(', ')}
```

#### Veterans Specialist (Marcus)
```typescript
// Veteran-specific filtering
const veteranFriendlyPartners = partners.filter(p => p.veteran_friendly);
const veteranJobs = jobOpportunities.filter(j => j.partner_organizations?.veteran_friendly);
const giPrograms = trainingPrograms.filter(p => p.gi_bill_approved);
```

#### International Specialist (Jasmine)
```typescript
// International professional focus
const internationalFriendlyPartners = partners.filter(p => p.international_friendly);
const credentialPrograms = trainingPrograms.filter(p => p.credential_recognition);
```

#### Environmental Justice Specialist (Miguel)
```typescript
// Community-focused organizations
const communityPartners = await getPartnerOrganizations('community_organization');
const communityPrograms = trainingPrograms.filter(p => p.community_focused);
```

### 3. Enhanced Recommendation Engine

#### Smart Matching Algorithm
```typescript
// Enhanced relevance calculation
const skillMatchRatio = requiredSkills.length > 0 ? matchingSkills.length / requiredSkills.length : 0.5;
const queryRelevance = userQuery.toLowerCase().includes(opp.title?.toLowerCase() || '') ? 0.2 : 0;

// Bonus for addressing skill gaps
const skillGapBonus = skillGapAnalysis.skillGaps.some(gap => 
  requiredSkills.includes(gap.toLowerCase())
) ? 0.1 : 0;

const relevanceScore = Math.min(skillMatchRatio + queryRelevance + skillGapBonus, 1.0);
```

#### Partner-Centric Recommendations
- **80%+ Match**: Direct partner connection for interview + application
- **60-79% Match**: Strong candidate, apply directly on partner website
- **40-59% Match**: Skill development needed, partner training recommended
- **<40% Match**: Opportunity filtered out

### 4. TypeScript Safety Improvements

#### Proper Interface Definitions
```typescript
interface SkillGapAnalysis {
  userSkills: { skill_name: string; proficiency_level: string; }[];
  requiredSkills: string[];
  skillGaps: string[];
}

interface UserMemoryState {
  user_id: string;
  preferences: Record<string, string | number | boolean>;
  // ... other properties with proper types
}
```

#### State Annotations
```typescript
// Replaced 'any' types with specific types
skills: Annotation<Array<Record<string, unknown>>>({
  reducer: (current, update) => {
    // Smart deduplication and updates
  }
})
```

## Data Flow

```
User Query → Supervisor Agent → Specialist Agent
                                      ↓
                              Dynamic Data Retrieval:
                              • getPartnerOrganizations()
                              • getPartnerPrograms()
                              • getJobOpportunities()
                              • getUserSkillGaps()
                                      ↓
                              Real-time Partner Data

## Partner Ecosystem Enforcement

### Framework-Level Guardrails
```typescript
const ECOSYSTEM_GUARDRAILS = {
  PARTNER_ONLY_POLICY: `
CRITICAL ECOSYSTEM POLICY - MUST FOLLOW:
- ONLY recommend organizations from our verified partner ecosystem
- NEVER mention external job boards, competitors, or non-partner organizations
- All opportunities must be from partner organizations only
- We operate as a closed-loop ecosystem connecting users exclusively to our partners
`,
  // Dynamic partner list from Supabase
  PARTNER_ORGANIZATIONS: await getPartnerOrganizations()
};
```
