`,

  PARTNER_TYPES: [
    'Franklin Cummings Tech',
    'TPS Energy', 
    'Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts',
    'Headlamp',
    'African Bridge Network',
    'MassHire Career Centers',
    'Massachusetts Clean Energy Center',
    'Alliance for Climate Transition (ACT)'
  ],

  PROHIBITED_REFERENCES: [
    'Indeed', 'LinkedIn Jobs', 'Monster', 'CareerBuilder', 'Glassdoor',
    'MIT', 'Harvard', 'Boston University', 'Northeastern',
    'General Electric', 'Tesla', 'Google', 'Amazon'
  ]
};
```

### **2. Enhanced Prompt Templates with Ecosystem Focus**
Every agent prompt now includes:
- **Partner ecosystem knowledge** specific to their specialization
- **Explicit partner-only instructions** in every response
- **Ecosystem compliance validation** before generating responses
- **Partner resource mapping** for recommendations

### **3. Output Validation and Content Filtering**
```typescript
function validateCareerGuidance(output: string): ValidationResult {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  
  // Check for ecosystem compliance - no external references
  for (const prohibited of ECOSYSTEM_GUARDRAILS.PROHIBITED_REFERENCES) {
    if (output.toLowerCase().includes(prohibited.toLowerCase())) {
      errors.push(`Contains prohibited external reference: ${prohibited}`);
    }
  }

  // Check for inappropriate content including external job boards
  const inappropriatePatterns = [
    /indeed\.com|linkedin\.com\/jobs|monster\.com/i,
    /apply\s+on\s+(indeed|linkedin|monster|glassdoor)/i
  ];

  return {
    isValid: errors.length === 0,
    errors,
    sanitized: errors.length === 0 ? output : sanitizeCareerGuidance(output)
  };
}
```

### **4. Content Sanitization**
```typescript
function sanitizeCareerGuidance(output: string): string {
  let sanitized = output;
  
  // Remove external job board references
  sanitized = sanitized.replace(/indeed\.com|linkedin\.com\/jobs|monster\.com|glassdoor\.com/gi, 'our partner websites');
  sanitized = sanitized.replace(/apply\s+on\s+(indeed|linkedin|monster|glassdoor)/gi, 'apply directly on partner websites');
  
  // Remove prohibited external references
  for (const prohibited of ECOSYSTEM_GUARDRAILS.PROHIBITED_REFERENCES) {
    const regex = new RegExp(prohibited, 'gi');
    sanitized = sanitized.replace(regex, 'our partner organizations');
  }
  
  return sanitized;
}
```
